# Workbench Mini Supply
A compact and portable power supply project designed to simplify the development of electronic projects.

## Project Overview
This project implements a **workshop power supply** with both **current** and **voltage limiting** capabilities. The design is intended for hobbyist use, particularly in environments where accidental miswiring of devices might occur. The power supply provides protection against improper connections and can switch between two power sources: a standard external power supply or a battery.


## Features
- **Voltage Regulation**: Adjustable output voltage up to 12V.
- **Current Limiting**: Prevents the output current from exceeding 1A.
- **Safety Features**: Protects against incorrect connections to ensure the longevity of connected devices.
- **Dual Power Source**: Supports switching between a power supply and a battery.
